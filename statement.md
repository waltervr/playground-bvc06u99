# Exercise 1: Create a Car Class

Create a Car class with two instance attributes:

- Color, which stores the name of the car’s color as a string.
- Mileage, which stores the number of miles on the car as an integer.
- Then instantiate two Car objects—a blue car with 20,000 miles and a red car with 30,000 miles—and print out their colors and mileage. 

**Your output should look like this:**
``` 
The blue car has 20,000 miles.
The red car has 30,000 miles.
```

# Exercise 2: Create an Animal Class

Create an Animal class with one instance attribute and one method:

- The instance attribute will be the *name*, which stores the name of the animal as a string.
- The method should return the sound of the animal, which returns the following string: "{variable_sound}, I'm {animal_name}! {variable_sound}"
- Then create two subclasses that inherits from the Animal class, and assign a sound to the instance attribute.
- Finally, create an instance of each of the subclasses and print the sound of each of them.

**Your output should look like below, considering you have a cow with sound Moooo and name Milky White:**
``` 
Moooo I'm Milky White! Moooo
```
